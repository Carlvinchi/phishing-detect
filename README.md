# phishing-detect

This project is part of my computing master's ML assessment 

The project was focused on using ML Techniques to detect phishing websites

- investigated Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and BernoulliNB

- explored feature selection using mutual information gain scores and correleational matrix

- explored model model optimisation using 

	- SMOTE to handle imbalance dataset
	
	- Hyperparamter tuning using GridSearch with RepeatedStratifiedKFoldValidation
  
- explored model explainability and interpretability using

	- SHAP library
	
	- LIME library
	
	- Feature Importance

Dataset and Code included for reproducibility of results
	
Open the notebook and run all the cells.

Enjoy!
